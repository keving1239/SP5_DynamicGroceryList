		<h2> Have you ever been in a hurry to leave the house and get to the store,
		and as sson as you are about to leabe someone asks you to grab something?
		Just when you get to the store you forget what that thing was and have to call
		that person to ask. no one wants to make that call, wouldn't is bee better to 
		have a sharable list that both parties can update and you wont have to worry
		about forgetting? We do to, so that is where the Dynamic GRocery List can save the day.
		Now you can create lists, share those lists with friends and family, update that list
		when something comes up, and make sure nothing is ever forgotten again. </h2>
